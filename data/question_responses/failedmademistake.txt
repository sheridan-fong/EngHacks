In my first job, my manager asked me to develop several forms of tracking projects. I said “yes” because I wanted to do everything my manager asked me to do. But as I started working on the project, I realized I didn't understand the overall goal. And the project ended up creating templates that didn't meet my manager's expectations. My manager was disappointed in me. She told me that if I had asked some clarifying questions, I would've gotten to a better work product. I admitted to my manager that I had made a mistake and learned that it doesn't make you look stupid if you ask clarifying questions. I learned that it's better to speak up quickly. That's how I've handled those situations ever since.
During my first few months in network planning, I worked to launch a new international route for a major airline. Months of work and detailed analysis goes into every new route as many candidates are narrowed down to a few worthy of a multi-million dollar investment. Regardless, this work needs to be done at a rapid pace and with a high level of confidentiality. My team moved quickly, and my work was shared with only a few key decision makers in the company to gain approval. Unfortunately, throughout the rapid pace of work, a few key stakeholders were left out of communications and felt unprepared. They were later left to scramble and quickly adapt when they heard about my project in the media. Learning from my mistake, I developed a robust checklist of each communication that would be required prior to all subsequent launches. I also adapted it for other teams to help my peers avoid a similar oversight.
While working in channel sales for a technology company that sold storage area network solutions, I made the mistake of announcing a new break/fix service that was not approved or rolled out internally yet. I had jumped the gun in assuming it was ready to go. As a result, over 50 global channel partners received the new program and some of them had already initiated quotes for end users. Once I realized my mistake, I sent out communication to the channel partners and owned up to it fully. Many reached out to me directly and were understandably confused and frustrated, but appreciated the transparency. I offered to speak to their customers and help with any quotes that may have been stuck. Ultimately, we were able to roll out the product fairly shortly thereafter, and there were no serious consequences. But I had learned my lesson. Since then, I’ve made more regular and effective communication a top priority. I make myself available and accessible to internal and external partners to keep a steady stream of information and updates flowing to avoid preventable errors.
As a second year digital executive at a leading snacks brand, I had an opportunity to either renew past sponsorships or seek new opportunities to associate our brand with top sports and entertainment properties. When I extended our contracts in fantasy football, I had my doubts of the effectiveness of the partnership and the overall lack of novelty after so many years. Compared to the actual NFL, fantasy football has a limited number of extremely dedicated fans and users. We had a true tradeoff of reach versus frequency. I worked with our agency partners to slash costs and develop numerous versions of compelling sweepstakes. We refreshed the creative constantly and monitored performance aggressively to avoid a negative ROI. But, despite all efforts, we struggled to get fans to engage. I wish I had trusted the numbers and my own intuition to consider other programs that would have been a much bigger success. It’s not easy to quickly acclimate at a top CPG company, but that experience taught me to bet on myself, seek mentors who can help guide me in a new culture, and never forget the importance of thanking teammates and partners for their hard work.
